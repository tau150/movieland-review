## General Considerations

- I implemented the requested features. For infinity scrolling I made what I would like to have as an user. The infinity scrolling is working for all the movies and for the search too. This allows the user to have a paginated search.


- Because of time limitation, even I think a lot of things in the original code can be improved I decided to modify as little as possible to complete the requests tasks and follow more or less the existing coding style. I know it was allow to change it, but I prefer to keep the conventions in the existing code.
